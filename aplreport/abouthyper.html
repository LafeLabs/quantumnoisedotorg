The purpose of this project is to document the use of the shot noise thermometer tunnel junction for amplifier calibration.  
However, this has already been published on at some length.  So, I ask, what is the most useful structure of a document like this?
I believe that this document should server two purposes.  The first is to directly aid in the practical operation of the 
shot noise jucntions in the lab, and the second is to help APL researchers to promote this project outside APL, making APL 
an important hub in this research, which should help in raising money in future work.  Both of these purposes are served not by 
creating any new information, but by <em>organizing</em> existing information. That is therefore what this document seeks to do.

Also, if this is to be a document that actually gets used, rathr than just printed out, read once, and forgotten about, it should be
mobile-friendly, and use the incredible power built into the web browser for data visualization and calculation.  To that end,
all information here is presented in html, and is posted on www.quantumnoise.org to maximize accessibility.  I will give a person to 
person tutorial on how to use all this information live at APL as well as how to install it behind an APL firewall for a more private
and freely editable version(as well as giving login information to APL staff for quantumnoise.org).

This document is broken up into three basic types of information: calculators, plotters, and notes.  Notes are the 
format we're all used to: just text with equations in latex format.  Latex is embedded into the html using the MathJax library.
Calculators are a set of application specific JavaScript web calculators useful for practical tunnel junction work which should 
enable the user to use any mobile phone, laptop, tablet or other web enabled device(e.g. smart watches) to isntantly compute needed
data.  Calculators are not just calculators in the traditional sense, however, they are social media, a cross between a webcalculator
and a microblogger like Twitter, which enables the user to publish every calculation to a publicly readable feed stored on the 
web server and backed up locally which allows all computations to be shared with the large community in real time.  The third 
form of information is the ploters, or graphics factories, which are web based programs that produce useful graphs, just as the calculators
produce useful numbers.  These graphs are in SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics) format, and are saved and displayed on the web
server, again like a microblogging site, for sharing with the community at large.  Each "note", "calculator" and "plotter" is intended
to be a more or less self contained unit of information, each with its own global URL as well as local file that can be 
copied, modified, and used by anyone.

It is hoped that by making all information about the shot noise calibration process available in a modular, live updated and  
mobile friendly format that this should both help APL researchers to more efficiently work on this project and perhaps more importantly
position APL as a resource in the community at large as th sponsor and creator of this information.  Essentially, this is 
social media specific to quantum noise for amplifier calibrations, with APL as the main hub and server for the network.  This
should then hopefully make APL a hub in the real world for this work, bringing future funding and fruitful collaborations to the group.
