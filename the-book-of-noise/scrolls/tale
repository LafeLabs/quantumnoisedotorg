I am Dr. Lafe Spietz, Ph.D. and I am the creator of the Quantum Noise Synth.

I started this project as a graduate student in [Rob Schoelkopf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Schoelkopf)'s lab, where I wrote my award-winning dissertation on using tunnel junctions as noise sources in [The Shot Noise Thermometer](https://lafelabs.github.io/sixbynine.pdf).  I continued working on it in Joe Aumentado's lab at NIST in Boulder.  After that I worked on it in collaboration with Yonuk Chong's lab at KRISS in South Korea. And then I worked on it with the quantum team at at JHU/APL.  Since moving back to Colorado, I have worked on turning the QNS into a collection of free open source hardware and software components which taken together can be used for a wide variety of strange and interesting physics, music, and art.  

I am extending my Ph.D. dissertation work into a self-replicating collection of things and files.  Files describe how physical things are to be replicated, and physical things all point back to the files.  This is what really free hardware looks like!  It self-replicates.  

After trying many schemes in business I have come to the conclusion that selling things is not the approach that works best for me as inventor. Rather, I propose to give everything away as freely as possible and help people copy the whole thing, and then separately ask for support from various sources for my ongoing efforts in this project.  The support and the distribution of technology are decoupled.  If people want to support me and get free stuff, that's fine! But they are not buying the stuff, they're just supporting the work and also copying it.  Those are two totally separate actions!

This is the story of QNS, then, it is a life long effort to both figure out the best way to distribute technology as an inventor and a lifelong effort to make it easier to do certain kinds of noise measurement. It is an integration of philosophy, technology, physics, art, and music.  It is "really really free" hardware! 

I am looking for support from different sources for different parts of the system.  And I am looking to build a network of creators who are all supported by this!  If you are an artist or musician who wants to experiment with quantum feedback and quantum analog signals, let's talk and find ways to collaborate and ways you can get supported materially by the network!  And I want to build a network of quantum labs who use the system to make art and use the art to spread their memes!  This is our story!  We are making self-replicating memes.  You all have memes.  Your lab, company, agency, and so on, you want to spread your memes.  We can all work as a network to do that! For free!  

We are looking to get government support for building a user facility in the EE cleanroom at University of Colorado Boulder which can be used for fabricating normal metal tunnel junctions.  We are also going to be looking for government grant support to train technicians to learn the whole system and to be able to make a lifetime supply of 50 ohm tunnel junctions for the whole world for many many years.  We will fabricate thousands of junctions and send dozens to hundreds of labs!
