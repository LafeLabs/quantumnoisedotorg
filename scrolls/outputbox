# Parts and assembly for output box

Signal goes from warm amp at top of fridge to this box by way of an SMA cable.  A bulkhead SMA feedthrough with SMA on both sides goes through the wall of an octagonal die cast aluminum box from Hammond.  A barrel inside changes genders and connects to a 20 dB LNA.  The output of the LNA goes to a bandpass filter and then into a power detector.  The output of the power detector goes into an audio amplifier, possibly with a blocking capacitor.  The audio amplifier has wires that go to the 3.5 mm aux output socket. Then a aux patch cable goes from there to speakers and or the computer and or other synth apparatus.  The RF amp, power sensor and audio amp all run on 5 volts, which is provided by a USB cable.
