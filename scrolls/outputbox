signal comes in through a SMA bulkhead into a aluminum enclosure.  A SMA cable inside connects to a pcb on standoffs on the base of the box which has SMA edge connectors in and out and which has a mechanically tuned series LC resonator at the input of a surface mount RF amp. The output of that amp can go directly to the power meter with no cable in between.  The output of the power meter has a SMA edge connector which we solder wires to which then solder to the board that is a audio amp, which has a capacitor in series with it to reject DC.
