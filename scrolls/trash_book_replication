let us use the "people's printer" to print books and distribute them for free.
in the people's printer, we find people who can print out large documents at work for free without anyone saying anything, and we ask them to print either a whole book or part of a book(using books in 8.5x11 pdf format).
any workplace with free printing is likely to also have trash bins or cabinets full of empty 3 ring binders for the taking, and 3 hole punches.  we ask people to punch holes and put them in binders, and then decorate the binders in the maximalist style of trash magic and distribute them freely.  They can then be placed in Little Free Libraries.  We can do this for the Books of Geometron and the Trash Magic Manifesto and that will spread the memes of trash magic.
