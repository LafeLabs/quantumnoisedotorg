# Fabrication
 
 - Dope the aluminum with manganese
 - Keep the copper layer but add thick gold to the top 
 - Keep the high current density 
 - Do the lithography in an existing university facility
 - Do the deposition in a machine we get bought for this exact purpose on a grant, installed at a university right by the lithography
 - Make a probe apparatus and protocol which works right after liftoff for rapid feedback
 - Open source the design in a modular way 
 - Optimize die size and shape for the flip chip probe design
