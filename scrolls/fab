# Fabrication

As of now, some people make their own junctions, but the best junctions in the world are being made at NIST Boulder in Joe Aumentado's lab in the NIST clean room.  These are very high current density junctions with thick copper on top of them for added electrical and thermal conductance from the junction, and a careful design that matches to the incoming transmission on a microwave printed circuit board. 

However these junctions require a permanent magnet to drive them from superconducting to normal at low temperatures, and need wire bonds to connect with the copper.  Ideally what we want for tunnel junctions in order to maximize their utility to the whole community is to use manganese doped aluminum which is always normal, and to add gold on top of the copper in the deposition, so that we can have a gold-gold contact in some kind of flip chip configuration in order to eliminate the wire bonds.

The best way to do this is to buy a new machine dedicated specifically for this purpose.  The problem with using any existing deposition system is that any system used for qubit fabrication will tend to not allow the use of magnetic materials like manganese. Anyone outside the superconducting qubit community is unlikely to have done the optimization of the oxide barrier and angle tilt stage which are needed to make tunnel junctions with a single step using the angle evaporation "Dolan bridge" method.  

Part of what is proposed in the present work here is the purchasing and configuration of a dedicated evaporator for this task in the CU Boulder EE clean room. This is a user facility, so once it is set up, it can be used for fabrication by the government, university professors, and private companies.  That clean room already has lithography capability, but it might be necessary to upgrade some of it in order to make this run smoothly.  We will propose putting all that together into a grant proposal along with both PI and technician time to set it all up.  

List of things we want to do in the fab to improve on existing devices
 
 - Dope the aluminum with manganese
 - Keep the copper layer but add thick gold to the top 
 - Keep the high current density 
 - Do the lithography in an existing university facility
 - Do the deposition in a machine we get bought for this exact purpose on a grant, installed at a university right by the lithography
 - Make a probe apparatus and protocol which works right after liftoff for rapid feedback
 - Open source the design in a modular way 
 - Optimize die size and shape for the flip chip probe design and maximum yield

dicing for the super tiny dice should probably be outsourced, can be done at for example:

Steps:

1. get low conductivity wafers and clean them, add oxide if needed, maybe use diamond or sapphire?
2. undercut resist spin and bake
3. top layer resist spin and bake
4. lithography for whole wafer with Raith e-beam writer
5. develop, inspect bridges
6. load into specialized deposition system, run a plasma clean step
7. deposit manganese doped aluminum at first angle
8. timed exposure to oxygen to create oxide tunnel barrier
9. deposit second angle of manganese doped aluminum
10. third angle deposition of copper, thick
11. probe test, feedback loop on development of process
12. liftoff, clean wafer
13. optical lithography for big pads(clean, spin, expose, develop)
14. clean and deposit gold, thick layer
15. probe, liftoff, spin on protection resist coating
16. outsourced wafer dicing
17. place dice in custom tunnel junction die storage containers
18. remove photoresist
19. place into packaging, which has already been soldered into PCB(with connectors in place)



We further propose to build a dedicated fabrication facility for depositing the metals in normal metal tunnel junctions for this purpose. That machine will be a clone in capability to "JoeTek", the custom-built junction deposition system at NIST boult by Joe Aumentado, but with the ability to dope the aluminum with manganese to make it normal at all temperatures without the need for a permanent magnet.  

We are building as part of this system a set of filters for the audio signal, one for use at 4 kelvin and one for use at the still in a dilution refrigerator.  A room temperature box will generate the audio AC bias signal and downconvert the RF noise coming out of the measurement channel of the dilution fridge into an audible range. Finally, this ramped white noise signal will be read into the web browser of any web enabled device(laptop, desktop, mobile, tablet, any operating system) which will convert that signal into the desired noise, gain and temperature metrology data needed by the quantum information technology community for both amplifier calibration and thermometry. 

The proposal is to estimate the total potential user base across the US initially for this technology, and then to raise funds to support building a lifetime supply for everyone in the world who might use such a thing, and use economies of scale to supply that whole demand for free as a research project.  This is a hybrid project: part commercialization, part government project, part academic collaboration and part art and music project.  We will find a government grant to build the microfabrication facility into an existing university user facility which already has optical and or e-beam lithography working.   This could be the University of Colorado, Boulder or the University of Central Florida for example, both of which have friendly faculty and existing fabrication user facilities.  With that facility in place, we can get a grant to support the time of Dr. Spietz and some labor for technicians to get trained on the process and work together to perfect it.
