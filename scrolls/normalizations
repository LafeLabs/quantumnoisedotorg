# normalizations
 
We define the normalized noise power to be 

$$
p = \frac{P}{4kTB},
$$

where P is the power in watts over a bandwidth B in hertz, T is the temperature in kelvin, and k is the Boltzmann constant of $1.380649 \times 10^{-23} J/K$. 

We define the normalized bias voltage to be 
 
$$
v = \frac{eV}{kT},
$$

where e is the charge on an electron, or $1.602176634\times10^{−19} C$, and V is the voltage across the junction in volts.
 
The normalized frequency is defined as

$$
\phi = frac{hf}{kT},
$$

where h is the Planck constant, equal to $6.62607015\times10^{−34}$ and f is the frequency in hertz.
