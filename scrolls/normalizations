We define the normalized noise power in kelvin units to be 

$$
p = \frac{P}{4kB},
$$

where P is the power in watts over a bandwidth B in hertz, and k is the Boltzmann constant which is defined to be the fixed value of $1.380649 \times 10^{-23} J/K$. 

We define the normalized bias voltage in dimensionless units to be 
 
$$
v = \frac{eV}{kT},
$$

where e is the charge on an electron, which is defined to be the fixed value of $1.602176634\times10^{−19} C$, and V is the voltage across the junction in volts.
 
The normalized frequency in dimensionless units is defined as

$$
\phi = \frac{hf}{kT},
$$

where h is the Planck constant, equal to $6.62607015\times10^{−34}$ and f is the frequency in hertz.

In these normalized units, the noise power at zero voltage and frequency is just 1.  The noise power at finite voltage is 

$$
p = T\left(\frac{v}{2}\right)\coth{\left(\frac{v}{2}\right)}.
$$

At zero bias and finite voltage, the noise power is 

$$
p = T\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)\coth{\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)}.
$$

And finally, the combined expression with finite voltage and frequency is 

$$
p = T\left[ \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{v + \phi}{2}\right)\coth{\left( \frac{v + \phi}{2}\right)} +\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{v - \phi}{2}\right)\coth{\left( \frac{v - \phi}{2}\right)}  \right]
$$


In these normalized units, we apply a voltage bias which ramps the amplitude of a sine wave from zero up to a normalized voltage of a few times the temperature in the classical case and a couple of times the frequency in the quantum case.  

Typical values for a dilution refrigerator might be a temperature of 10 mK, a frequency of 8 GHz, which is about 0.4 kelvin, so that if we want to go to about double that, the amplitude of v ranges up to about 80, the equivalent of about 0.8 kelvin.  So we say that v ranges up to 80 and $\phi$ is 40.  

The values for a junction run in a classical mode where there is no frequency dependence are typically about up to a bias amplitude of 8-10 in normalized units.  

Finally, we create computer files with graphs of these responses width and height equal to some number of pixels called [graphsize].  So we need a function which maps the stimulus sweep as well as the noise power response onto this geometry.  This square sits in a larger square of size [squaresize], with a margin around the square graph with width equal to [margin]. 


The unit of all graphs we make on the computer with [p5js](scrolls/p5js) are pixels.  The final transformation of anything we want to plot must be to this unit. 

We must finally note that the y axis on a canvas in p5js sets zero at the top of the canvas rather than the bottom, and increasing "y" values go down the screen rather than up.  So if we want to plot a ramp bias which goes from 0 to vmax across a square, it will be a line of slope 1/2 starting at ([margin],[margin] + 0.5*[graphsize]) and going up to ([margin] + [graphsize],[margin]).  If we multiply this ramp by a cosine wave with period equal to "period" in units of pixels, we get a total bias of 

$$
v =  \frac{1}{2}x\cos{2\pi x/[period]},
$$

where x is the distance of a given point over from [margin] in the square.  As x goes up to a maximum value of [graphsize], this will go up to the top of the graph.
