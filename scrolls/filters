# filters
 
This project will construct a standard filter design for use with the AC audio bias lines that go down into a dilution refrigerator.  These will be lumped element RC line filters potted with ecosorb epoxy.  Designs will be open source and modular.   

Filters will also serve as attenuators and heat sinks. There will be one filter at 4 kelvin, one at the still at a few hundred mK, and one integrated into the capsule which contains the tunnel junction.
