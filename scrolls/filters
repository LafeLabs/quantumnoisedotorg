# Free Filters!

This is the physical heart of the QNS.  It is the box in which we place the various different devices which make up the system.

## QNS Standard Filter

We use a filter which attenuates voltage by 10x, blocks DC, has a bias resistor to ground, and rolls off with several poles above a few kHz.  

Here is a schematic of this filter:

Here is a plot of calculated insertion loss of that filter:

## QNS Tunnel Junction Bias Capsule

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/cold-box-schematic.svg)

The inductor is a [conical bias tee inductor](https://www.coilcraft.com/en-us/products/rf/conical-broadband/0-40-ghz/bcl/) of a few microhenries from [Coilcraft](https://www.coilcraft.com/).  The tunnel junction has a DC path to ground through the bias resistor, but no DC path to the outside world.  This should improve both thermalization and make it harder to destroy junctions by accident.  The bias applied from the input side causes fluctuations in the white noise generated by the junction, which goes through the RF amplifier chain to the QNS Downconversion capsule.

## QNS Downconversion Capsule

A bandpass filter lets in only the RF band we are interested in.  This signal is rectified with a fast diode, and that rectified signal is put through another band pass in the audio range we are interested in, generally from a few hundred Hz through a few kHz.

There is a good chance that a better solution than making a special capsule is to use off the shelf packaged parts, including an RF bandpass  filter and a detector with an SMA connector like [this one from ebay for 30 dollars](https://www.ebay.com/itm/353594431694) or [this one from ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/266261361915). also bandpass filters [like this can be found on ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/125930411932). So we have a bandpass, followed by a RF detector, which should then get followed by a low pass like [this one from minicircuits](https://www.minicircuits.com/WebStore/dashboard.html?model=SLP-1.9%2B) and then a DC block, which can be a simple capsule which just filters the audio, rejecting DC with a capacitor and cutting the ultrasonic components way down.  So we have a COTS filter with SMA, a COTS detector with SMA, then a bandpass like all the other ones that gets rid of everything you can't hear and also the stuff below about 10  to 100 Hz.    

## QNS Capsule Design

Every stage in the above system, both warm and cold, is the same design of both the capsule and the printed circuit board which goes inside the capsule.  Only the component values and locations change from one stage to the next. 

Machine these out of brass or gold plated OFHC copper.

This design is used for all elements of the system.  

The M4 through hole is for mounting on the various plates of a [Bluefors](https://bluefors.com/) dilution refrigerator.  The diameter should be 4.5 mm for a medium fit.  Threaded holes in the corners are M2 threads for the lid screws. 

The lid is slightly smaller than the body of the capsule so that the edges never interfere with the flush contact of the body with the mounting plate.  

Should the lid or body have some kind of holes to make sure that gas can get removed easily?  Design options here must be explored.

Also, a threaded hole in the lid could be used as a tuner with an insulating screw.

## QNS printed circuit board(PCB)

Standard FR4 circuit boards are about 1.6 mm in thickness, and have a dielectric constant of about 3.8-4.8.  We want a 3 mm wide center line, which gives a gap of about 300 microns to be 50 ohms.

Get these boards made with FR4, no soldermask, backside can be a ground plane or not, test both.
