# crowdfund
 
What if we can crowd fund the whole thing?  I can raise money through upcycle robotics and pay that out to clean rooms and fab people to go do the fab.  That can all get published here.  I'll pay for my time and also another persons time so that they learn how to do the fab. And I'll pay for the cleanroom hourly charges out of upcyle robotics money.  I can pay the trash magic network to go build this.
