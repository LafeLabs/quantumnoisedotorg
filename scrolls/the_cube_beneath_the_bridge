create a Geometron Hypercube instance, which is a 4 inch cube according to the directions on the link from the upper left corner of this page.  Place it under a bridge out of the rain.  Share the location with another magician who can quest to find the cube and place media in it.  We can then build a network of magicians going to the cube and picking up media and putting it down.
