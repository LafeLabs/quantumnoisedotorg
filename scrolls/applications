# applications
 
- Calibration standard for thermometers
- Thermodynamic temperature standard for defining the SI kelvin below 1 K
- Calibration of noise and gain in commercial superconducting quantum amplifiers 
- Calibration of noise and gain in measurement systems for dark matter searches
- Guitar pedal/synth module for creating experimental music projects
- Analog quantum information processing based on interaction with complex quantum circuits
- Classroom and street demonstration of quantum tunneling at room temperature with waste stream materials


These applications all need different figures of merit to be optimized, and it makes sense to build different version of the QNS for the different applications.
