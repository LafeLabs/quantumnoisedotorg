# Cold, Dark, Blacker than the Blackest Black

If you look in the coldest darkest blackest parts of space you see thermal radiation at a few kelvin.  In dark matter searches, physicists use dilution refrigerators to cool down resonators to 1 one hundredth of a degree above absolute zero, and essentially point a radio telescope into the fridge to look at the coldest blackest darkest reaches of reality itself.  It is in this same cold dark world of quantum noise whispers that quantum computers are also read out, with their complex analog control signals which must be read out with the same technology as the dark matter searches.  

The QNS is a source of noise which can be calibrated from the physics of the tunnel junction, which can be used to measure noise and gain of the amplifiers which are used to read out these cold dark radios.  By running it in a superconducting mode, the junction can also be used to broadcast high power microwave signals at many frequencies into a quantum circuit, as well as broadband noise. This will allow us to put whole quantum circuits into audio feedback loops. These audio feedback loops can then be programmed with algorithms which can then evolve the signal which controls the junction bias.  This allows us to build quantum machine learning algorithms using nothing but simple manipulation of audio signals.  These audio signals can then control geometry using geometron, and we can then evolve that geometry using the quantum machine learning.  If physics and chemistry problems can be mapped to geometry and we can then evolve the geometry, it opens up ways to program quantum processors with geometry in and geometry out.  This is an alternative to the paradigm of the quantum "computer".  Perhaps it can lead to advances in simulation of quantum chemistry.

This is the union of analog quantum information processing, trash magic self replicating code in the web browser which uses p5js, machine learning, quantum noise metrology, quantum virtual reality, geometron geometric programming, and thermometry.  

Finally, we aim to set this system up as a temperature measurement apparatus and use it to determine the SI kelvin below 1 kelvin.  This work can be done at NIST, CU Boulder, APL, UCF and Yale Quantum Institute.  QNS will distribute the devices and wiring free to the people who can use them and help figure out how to get them going.
