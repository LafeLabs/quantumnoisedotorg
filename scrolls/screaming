# SCREAMING SUPERCONDUCTORS!
 


The same exact circuit as was used for the quantum noise generator with a normal-state junction can be used to generate intense microwave radiation with a superconducting tunnel junction.  The incoming audio bias in the input side of our quantum guitar pedal controls the current bias on a Josephson junction, which is the equivalent of applying torque to a pendulum, and it can spin up very intense oscillations in the range of GHz up to 10's or even 100's of GHz.  These intense analog-controlled microwave signals can then be pointed at networks of qubits and microwave resonators, ringing them all up.  Then the output of that system can be amplified by the same quantum amplifiers that we are calibrating in the normal-metal junction experiments.  We mix it down exactly in the same was as in those experiments as well, making a guitar pedal output which we can then read into a web browser. 

This is a path to building algorithms to program quantum circuits which totally abandon the idea of building algorithms with gates and qubit states as a drop in replacement for the logic gates used in classical computing.  We aim to build totally analog algorithms, and to have those algorithms always be generating things in the Open Web.  They can then use the Open Web to interact with people, making a quantum trash magic social media network!

Then these systems can be used to map the media of different science problems into the space of symbols in a browser.  If we can map quantum analog signals to symbols in a browser, and map those symbols to the solutions of different science problems, we can program quantum circuits to solve science problems.  And we can do it without ever building an algorithm using gates!  We are not trying to create algorithms we understand, merely to find ways to map evolution parameters into a thing we can program. 



This is all inspired by the TikTok algorithm, which is clearly creating structures that the architects of the algorithm don't plan, but which are emergent and are created by the people who participate in them.  That is what this is. Quantum Trash Magic is self-replicating media made from trash which operates on this principle.
