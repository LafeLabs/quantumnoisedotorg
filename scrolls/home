# The Quantum Noise Synth

 3. Everything lives in a [Web Browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser)

## Signal Path

The signal path starts with sounds generated in a web browser using the p5js JavaScript library.

2. [Amplitude ramp generator](playramp.html)
3. [Frequency sweep generator](playsweep.html)
4. [Read the response spectra](https://quantumnoise.org/QNS-spectra.html)

This signal can be fed to either a room temperature noise test probe or a into the dilution refrigerator measurement chain. The latter starts with a box that takes in a 3.5 mm aux cable, breaks ground, attenuates power, filters out high frequency signals, and feeds into the top of the fridge by way of an SMA cable.

In all there are three filter boxes, one at room temperature, one at 4k and one at the still.

After going through the whole RF chain, we finally get out an audio signal, making the WHOLE system into a guitar pedal.  This can then be read out into another web browser which turns the sound into a heat map of noise power as a function of temperature and frequency.



The Quantum Noise Synth is a way of reading out the noise from a normal metal tunnel junction in which the junction is biased with a ramped sine wave in the audio frequency range, with zero DC bias.  This acts like a module in a [modular synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_synthesizer), taking an input signal in the audio range, and eventually converting it back into an audio output signal based on the mixed down noise from a microwave frequency.

The advantages of this method of reading out the noise noise from a tunnel junction are that we can have no DC connection with the junction, which should make it less susceptible to electrostatic damage and also to low frequency noise(which can be filtered out).  By blocking all DC current coming into the junction, we can add a DC path to ground through a bias resistor, vastly improving the thermal anchoring to whatever is being measured. We will build the bias tee for this into a custom enclosure along with a filter and a set of contacts for a flip chip geometry, removing the need for wire bonds.  

We further propose to build a dedicated fabrication facility for depositing the metals in normal metal tunnel junctions for this purpose. That machine will be a clone in capability to "JoeTek", the custom-built junction deposition system at NIST boult by Joe Aumentado, but with the ability to dope the aluminum with manganese to make it normal at all temperatures without the need for a permanent magnet.  

We are building as part of this system a set of filters for the audio signal, one for use at 4 kelvin and one for use at the still in a dilution refrigerator.  A room temperature box will generate the audio AC bias signal and downconvert the RF noise coming out of the measurement channel of the dilution fridge into an audible range. Finally, this ramped white noise signal will be read into the web browser of any web enabled device(laptop, desktop, mobile, tablet, any operating system) which will convert that signal into the desired noise, gain and temperature metrology data needed by the quantum information technology community for both amplifier calibration and thermometry. 

The proposal is to estimate the total potential user base across the US initially for this technology, and then to raise funds to support building a lifetime supply for everyone in the world who might use such a thing, and use economies of scale to supply that whole demand for free as a research project.  This is a hybrid project: part commercialization, part government project, part academic collaboration and part art and music project.  We will find a government grant to build the microfabrication facility into an existing university user facility which already has optical and or e-beam lithography working.   This could be the University of Colorado, Boulder or the University of Central Florida for example, both of which have friendly faculty and existing fabrication user facilities.  With that facility in place, we can get a grant to support the time of Dr. Spietz and some labor for technicians to get trained on the process and work together to perfect it.  

To analyze how signals are transformed by the QNS, we use a set of units normalized by fundamental constants and the system temperature, namely the normalized bias voltage indicated by a lowercase v, normalized frequency $\phi$ and normalized noise power in temperature units $p$:

$$
v \equiv \frac{eV}{kT}
$$

$$
\phi \equiv \frac{hf}{kT}
$$

$$
p \equiv \frac{P}{4kB},
$$

where k is the Boltzmann constant now fixed by the quantum SI to be $1.380649\times10^{-23} J/K$, e is the elementary charge, now fixed by the quantum SI to be $1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}C$, B is the effective bandwidth of the noise power measurement in hertz, f is the frequency in hertz at which noise is measured, T is the absolute temperature in kelvin, and P is the power in watts.  The normalized expression for the noise power response p as a function of v for fixed $\phi$ is as follows:

$$
p = T\left[ \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{v + \phi}{2}\right)\coth{\left( \frac{v + \phi}{2}\right)} +\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{v - \phi}{2}\right)\coth{\left( \frac{v - \phi}{2}\right)}  \right],
$$

which reduces to 

$$
p = T
$$

for $v = 0$ and $\phi = 0$ and 

$$
p = T\left(\frac{v}{2}\right)\coth{\left(\frac{v}{2}\right)}.
$$
for $\phi = 0$, and 

$$
p = T\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)\coth{\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)}.
$$
for $v = 0$.

The full expression for p as a function of v with $\phi>>1$ shows the flat-bottomed v curve below:

The bias we apply to this is a linear ramped sine wave which looks like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/response.png)

The response to the ramped stimulus is shown above.  As long as the peak value of the AC bias wave is below the quantum knee at $v = \phi$, there is almost no response, then the response suddenly turns on as that threshold is reached. This calibrates the time axis of the response curves using the value of that quantum frequency, which can be known quite accurately, hence calibrating the time axis in units of temperature.  Since the slope of the shot noise response is known, this also calibrates the vertical axis in units of temperature, which is the desired result for both noise and temperature metrology.  This calibration process is for the both the audio bias and RF response *directly across the junction*, so it removes both the attenuation going down to the junction and the gain going back up.



That is the magic of the QNS!  It takes audio signals as input, puts out audio signals as output, and calibrates out all of the various artifacts between the audio system and the quantum tunnel junction.  

To get a nice curve like the one showed above for a system with about 7 GHz noise power center frequency and 10 millikelvin physical temperature, we get a value of $\phi \approx 30$ and so we aim for a max value of v of about 60.  This is a voltage in SI units of 50 microvolts. So for typical audio signals we might have hundreds of millivolts at the top of the fridge and so want to attenuate about about a factor of ten to the fourth.  This will attenuate power by a factor of ten to the eighth. 

To play a tone into the system, go to the [playramp.html](playramp.html) p5js application.  You can set any frequency you want, as well as any sweep rate.  This can be played from any device: mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desk top.  Then that signal will want to get attenuated and filtered and applied to the tunnel junction, and you take the RF signal from the tunnel junction, amplify it, mix it down into an audio signal and play it into another machine running a web browser and read it into the [qns p5js app](qns.html).
