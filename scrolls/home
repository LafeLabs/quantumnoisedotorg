## Signal Path

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/whole-system-schematic.svg)

Audio signal goes through a series of filters down into a dilution refrigerator, and then biases a tunnel junction, which produces RF noise, which gets amplified, filtered, mixed back down into the audio, and filtered again, then out via an SMA which is converted to audio cables.

## Audio tone generation

We can generate tones from any web enabled device by using the [p5js JavaScript Library](https://p5js.org).  This is a library designed for artists, which has built in libraries for making and analyzing sounds which we will use in the QNS system.

## QNS Standard Filter

We use a filter which attenuates voltage by 10x, blocks DC, has a bias resistor to ground, and rolls off with several poles above a few kHz.  

Here is a schematic of this filter:

Here is a plot of calculated insertion loss of that filter:

## QNS Tunnel Junction Bias Capsule

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/cold-box-schematic.svg)

The inductor is a [conical bias tee inductor](https://www.coilcraft.com/en-us/products/rf/conical-broadband/0-40-ghz/bcl/) of a few microhenries from [Coilcraft](https://www.coilcraft.com/).  The tunnel junction has a DC path to ground through the bias resistor, but no DC path to the outside world.  This should improve both thermalization and make it harder to destroy junctions by accident.  The bias applied from the input side causes fluctuations in the white noise generated by the junction, which goes through the RF amplifier chain to the QNS Downconversion capsule.

## QNS Downconversion Capsule

A bandpass filter lets in only the RF band we are interested in.  This signal is rectified with a fast diode, and that rectified signal is put through another band pass in the audio range we are interested in, generally from a few hundred Hz through a few kHz.

[Physics Simulator in p5js](fermi.html)

To analyze how signals are transformed by the QNS, we use a set of units normalized by fundamental constants and the system temperature, namely the normalized bias voltage indicated by a lowercase v, normalized frequency $\phi$ and normalized noise power in temperature units $p$:

$$
v \equiv \frac{eV}{kT}
$$

$$
\phi \equiv \frac{hf}{kT}
$$

$$
p \equiv \frac{P}{4kB},
$$

where k is the Boltzmann constant now fixed by the quantum SI to be $1.380649\times10^{-23} J/K$, e is the elementary charge, now fixed by the quantum SI to be $1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}C$, B is the effective bandwidth of the noise power measurement in hertz, f is the frequency in hertz at which noise is measured, T is the absolute temperature in kelvin, and P is the power in watts.  The normalized expression for the noise power response p as a function of v for fixed $\phi$ is as follows:

$$
p = T\left[ \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{v + \phi}{2}\right)\coth{\left( \frac{v + \phi}{2}\right)} +\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{v - \phi}{2}\right)\coth{\left( \frac{v - \phi}{2}\right)}  \right],
$$

which reduces to 

$$
p = T
$$

for $v = 0$ and $\phi = 0$ and 

$$
p = T\left(\frac{v}{2}\right)\coth{\left(\frac{v}{2}\right)}.
$$
for $\phi = 0$, and 

$$
p = T\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)\coth{\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)}.
$$
for $v = 0$.

The full expression for p as a function of v with $\phi>>1$ shows the flat-bottomed v curve below:

![theoretical quantum noise curve with no units](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/coth-frontpage.png)

The bias we apply to this is a linear ramped sine wave which looks like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/stimulus.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/inarrow.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/in-out-capsule.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/outarrow.png)


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/response.png)

The response to the ramped stimulus is shown above.  As long as the peak value of the AC bias wave is below the quantum knee at $v = \phi$, there is almost no response, then the response suddenly turns on as that threshold is reached. This calibrates the time axis of the response curves using the value of that quantum frequency, which can be known quite accurately, hence calibrating the time axis in units of temperature.  Since the slope of the shot noise response is known, this also calibrates the vertical axis in units of temperature, which is the desired result for both noise and temperature metrology.  This calibration process is for the both the audio bias and RF response *directly across the junction*, so it removes both the attenuation going down to the junction and the gain going back up.

That is the magic of the QNS!  It takes audio signals as input, puts out audio signals as output, and calibrates out all of the various artifacts between the audio system and the quantum tunnel junction.  

To get a nice curve like the one showed above for a system with about 7 GHz noise power center frequency and 10 millikelvin physical temperature, we get a value of $\phi \approx 30$ and so we aim for a max value of v of about 60.  This is a voltage in SI units of 50 microvolts. So for typical audio signals we might have hundreds of millivolts at the top of the fridge and so want to attenuate about about a factor of ten to the fourth.  This will attenuate power by a factor of ten to the eighth. Hence we have four stages of the standard QNS filter which attenuates voltage by a factor of 10.


## The Quantum Guitar Pedal

How is it that this is a guitar pedal?  It is an analog circuit with a real time input and output, in the audio frequency range, and we always use connector adapters to make the whole system plugs directly into the signal path of a pedal board.

But at the end of the day what makes it a guitar pedal is that we will actually put this in the signal chain of an active music setup. This is intended to be a fully playable apparatus.  And part of that is building the *social* network required to get the right sort of experimental musicians to show up and try this out.  Ideally we can find the overlap of riff magicians, pedal nerds, modular synth weirdos, and general eccentrics who can see the artistic appeal of playing the quantum noise as an instrument.

## The QNS Distribution

We will provide all parts of this system for free to anyone who can make good use of them.  We will raise funds to support this project, separate from the user base.  Users might put into the crowd fund, but they are not "buying" the individual units.  Users get the unit that is most appropriate for their application, whatever that may be. 

Our objective is to bring this technology, for free, to anyone anywhere in the world who can make use of it.  This means "free like freedom" in the sense that all work is Public Domain and fully documented online, as well as "free like beer" in that users do not need to put any money in to join the network.  It is also "free like food not bombs" in the sense that we are looking to invite people in to the network of users with as little barriers as possible.  We aim in particular to create network linkages between music and art networks and physics and technology networks, so that musicians and artists can easily collaborate to connect their work with live QNS instances.

We also will create a room temperature version which can run anywhere, and in which the junction noise is calibrated using the known physical temperature and some calibration standards.  

## The QNS Junction Fabrication

We will need to find or create a user facility which can allow all parties use of the system, which can do the deposition of metals to make the junction as well as the lithography required for the fabrication.

Junctions will use the Dolan Bridge angle evaporation technique. We need to drive the aluminum normal using manganese doping so that a permanent magnet is not needed to drive the aluminum normal.  No one who cares about qubits at all wants manganese anywhere near their evaporator, but they are typically the only people who have carefully calibrated systems for fabricating tunnel junctions(we need an angle stage, repeatable oxidation, and reasonably well calibrated film thickness sensors).  So what will probably be needed is installing a dedicated system for these types of junctions.  

Such a system can then supply a wide range of normal aluminum tunnel junctions to a wide range of experiments, at least in theory. And we need it set up to deposit both copper and gold. The design presented here need gold contacts for the flip chip configuration to avoid wire bonding, and in order to avoid the dreaded "purple plague" we need copper between the aluminum and gold.  Copper and gold are both deposited as thick as we can get away with to maximize both electrical and thermal conductivity.  

This facility should be in a place that can allow people from anywhere to get access, even if it's just for a single deposition.  This is possible in a number of university clean rooms, but we will probably want to site it at the University of Colorado Boulder EE department since I can get there on the bus and have worked in that facility before.  

The layout of the chip is as simple as we can make it.  We make it as small and simple as possible rather than attempting to match to a transmission line impedance.  The purple lines in the following cartoon are only there to guide the eye and show how the symmetry works.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/die-layout.svg)

The exact dimensions will require some experimentation, and will partly depend on limitations of available dicing technologies.  How small a die can we make? That will depend on the tool we use. It might make sense to use an outsourced laser dicing process, but this will have to be researched as part of the overall fabrication research.


## The QNS Junction Packaging

We aim to make a flip chip geometry where some kind of spring mechanism pushes the chip against gold plated leads, with gold-on-gold contact.  There are a number of possible ways to do this.  This is also a subject which must be actively researched, and a number of options tried.  

## Quantum Philosophy

Is the quantum tunnel junction "interesting" from the standpoint of studying the philosophy of quantum mechanics?  Maybe.  There are a few aspects of this that are potentially interesting. 

 First of all, the shot noise from a tunnel junction is a demonstration of wave-particle duality.  Without the wave nature of the electron, there would be not tunneling, and without the particle nature it would have no shot noise, and the numerical value of that noise is determined by the quantum of charge e.  Can this be seen as a sort of wave function "collapse"?  What does that mean? I have no idea. But perhaps having more people looking at it and thinking about it will bring some ideas to light about what it means.

Also, what does it mean to play out the sound of the vacuum?  Surely a hiss is just a hiss. We can't tell white noise coming from one source from any other.  But perhaps people will find some value in the fact that they can directly interact with this very weird and very fundamental kind of fluctuation. These fluctuations are what are there when nothing else is.  Is that interesting philosophically?  

My hope is that all this will turn out to be interesting not so much in terms of what physicists have called "fundamental" for the last 100 or so years, but in terms of how people are able to personally, physically and mentally relate to quantum systems.  I believe that there is value in building a room temperature system which can be demonstrated for a few bucks' worth of materials and played by musicians with zero technical background.  I believe that value is of a philosophical nature.
