## Signal Path

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/whole-system-schematic.svg)

Audio signal goes through a series of filters down into a dilution refrigerator, and then biases a tunnel junction, which produces RF noise, which gets amplified, filtered, mixed back down into the audio, and filtered again, then out via an SMA which is converted to audio cables.

## Audio tone generation

We can generate tones from any web enabled device by using the [p5js JavaScript Library](https://p5js.org).  This is a library designed for artists, which has built in libraries for making and analyzing sounds which we will use in the QNS system.

This design is used for all elements of the system.

Get these boards made with FR4, no soldermask, backside can be a ground plane or not, test both.

## QNS Standard Filter

We use a filter which attenuates voltage by 10x, blocks DC, has a bias resistor to ground, and rolls off with several poles above a few kHz.  

Here is a schematic of this filter:

Here is a plot of calculated insertion loss of that filter:

## QNS Tunnel Junction Bias Capsule

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/cold-box-schematic.svg)

The inductor is a conical bias tee inductor of a few microhenries from Coilcraft.  The tunnel junction has a DC path to ground through the bias resistor, but no DC path to the outside world.  This should improve both thermalization and make it harder to destroy junctions by accident.  The bias applied from the input side causes fluctuations in the white noise generated by the junction, which goes through the RF amplifier chain to the QNS Downconversion capsule.

## QNS Downconversion Capsule

A bandpass filter lets in only the RF band we are interested in.  This signal is rectified with a fast diode, and that rectified signal is put through another band pass in the audio range we are interested in, generally from a few hundred Hz through a few kHz.

## Junction response Theory


To analyze how signals are transformed by the QNS, we use a set of units normalized by fundamental constants and the system temperature, namely the normalized bias voltage indicated by a lowercase v, normalized frequency $\phi$ and normalized noise power in temperature units $p$:

$$
v \equiv \frac{eV}{kT}
$$

$$
\phi \equiv \frac{hf}{kT}
$$

$$
p \equiv \frac{P}{4kB},
$$

where k is the Boltzmann constant now fixed by the quantum SI to be $1.380649\times10^{-23} J/K$, e is the elementary charge, now fixed by the quantum SI to be $1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}C$, B is the effective bandwidth of the noise power measurement in hertz, f is the frequency in hertz at which noise is measured, T is the absolute temperature in kelvin, and P is the power in watts.  The normalized expression for the noise power response p as a function of v for fixed $\phi$ is as follows:

$$
p = T\left[ \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{v + \phi}{2}\right)\coth{\left( \frac{v + \phi}{2}\right)} +\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{v - \phi}{2}\right)\coth{\left( \frac{v - \phi}{2}\right)}  \right],
$$

which reduces to 

$$
p = T
$$

for $v = 0$ and $\phi = 0$ and 

$$
p = T\left(\frac{v}{2}\right)\coth{\left(\frac{v}{2}\right)}.
$$
for $\phi = 0$, and 

$$
p = T\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)\coth{\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)}.
$$
for $v = 0$.

The full expression for p as a function of v with $\phi>>1$ shows the flat-bottomed v curve below:

The bias we apply to this is a linear ramped sine wave which looks like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/quantumnoisedotorg/master/trashmagic/response.png)

The response to the ramped stimulus is shown above.  As long as the peak value of the AC bias wave is below the quantum knee at $v = \phi$, there is almost no response, then the response suddenly turns on as that threshold is reached. This calibrates the time axis of the response curves using the value of that quantum frequency, which can be known quite accurately, hence calibrating the time axis in units of temperature.  Since the slope of the shot noise response is known, this also calibrates the vertical axis in units of temperature, which is the desired result for both noise and temperature metrology.  This calibration process is for the both the audio bias and RF response *directly across the junction*, so it removes both the attenuation going down to the junction and the gain going back up.



That is the magic of the QNS!  It takes audio signals as input, puts out audio signals as output, and calibrates out all of the various artifacts between the audio system and the quantum tunnel junction.  

To get a nice curve like the one showed above for a system with about 7 GHz noise power center frequency and 10 millikelvin physical temperature, we get a value of $\phi \approx 30$ and so we aim for a max value of v of about 60.  This is a voltage in SI units of 50 microvolts. So for typical audio signals we might have hundreds of millivolts at the top of the fridge and so want to attenuate about about a factor of ten to the fourth.  This will attenuate power by a factor of ten to the eighth. 

To play a tone into the system, go to the [playramp.html](playramp.html) p5js application.  You can set any frequency you want, as well as any sweep rate.  This can be played from any device: mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desk top.  Then that signal will want to get attenuated and filtered and applied to the tunnel junction, and you take the RF signal from the tunnel junction, amplify it, mix it down into an audio signal and play it into another machine running a web browser and read it into the [qns p5js app](qns.html).
